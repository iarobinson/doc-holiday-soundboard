# A simple drum machine

This is a project to fulfill one of the front end development projects which make up the Free Code Camp curriculum.

Because this is a single page application, I think it makes most sense to build it with a very simple, boilerplat type front end framework. I'll us Skeleton as it's mobile responsive and very light. Also, I plan to use vanilla JavaScript at this point because I think the application is quite simple and keeping it as 'bare bones' as possible will be more maintainable. 

## Thank you

Thank you to to dhg (github.com/dhg) for the Skeleton framework.
